# Sample Ansible Inventory File

[rhel_servers]
# Replace with the hostname or IP address of your target server
server1.example.com

# You can add more hosts to this group
# server2.example.com
# 192.168.1.101

# It's a good practice to define connection variables in a group_vars file
# but you can also define them here per host, for example:
# server1.example.com ansible_user=your_user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your_key
