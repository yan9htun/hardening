# Sample Ansible Inventory File
#
# This file is used to define the hosts that Ansible will manage.
# You can define hosts in groups.

[all:vars]
# It's a good practice to define common variables for all hosts here.
# For example, you can define the ansible user for all hosts.
# ansible_user=your_user
# ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your_key

[rhel_servers]
# Add your Red Hat based servers here
# server1.example.com
# 192.168.1.101

[debian_servers]
# Add your Debian based servers here
# server2.example.com

# You can also define host-specific variables
# server3.example.com ansible_user=another_user ansible_port=2222

# The playbooks target all hosts in the inventory (`hosts: all`).
# If you want to run the playbooks only on a specific group, you can use the --limit flag:
# ansible-playbook -i inventory scan.yml --limit rhel_servers
